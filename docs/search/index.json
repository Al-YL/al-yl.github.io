[{"content":"What is Compact Groups of Galaxies ? As the name suggests, a compact group of galaxies (CG, hereafter) is a kind of special galaxy system where the galaxy members are separated at distances of the order of galaxy size.\nThe above image shows a very typical CG, Stephan’s Quintet, which is photoed by James Webb Space Telescope. Although we call it a “Quintet\u0026quot;, only four of them on the right side of the image are truly close together. The leftmost one, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four galaxies.\nIn CGs, galaxy members frequently interact each other and are expected to form a single elliptical galaxy within a short period. The high density and low velocity dispersion make CG an ideal laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the merging process.\nThe Catalogs of Compact Groups of Galaxies To study the properties of CGs, we select CGs in the Main Galaxy Sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The SDSS Main Galaxy Sample is taken from NYU-VAGC. The original imaging and spectro files are avaliable here. We select the Main Galaxy Sample that contains $\\sim 700,000$ nearby galaxies with redshift $z \\le 0.2$ and $r$-band magnitude of $14.00 \\le r \\le 17.77$, and update their redshift data to the version of SDSS DR14.\nDue to the Fiber Collision Effect, not all of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshift, especially for the galaxies live in a higher number density region. The search for CGs is severely hindered by such effect.\nTo reduce the incompleteness as much as possible, we take the complementary redshift measurements from GAMA and LAMOST datasets. The incompleteness has been reduced from $\\sim 7$ % to $\\sim 5$ %. And we constructed the largest and most complete CG catalogs to date.\nSee this paper for more details in CG selection. Finally, our samples include 6128 CGs with complete redshifts and 8022 CG candidates which might contain interlopers. The original catalog in contains 6144 CGs. However, we remove 16 CGs after a careful inspection of the spectroscopic data of all group members, where the spectroscopic redshifts of few member galaxies have been incorrectly reused during the CG construction. These catalogs are avaliable here: Old Version (2020.01.02); Latest Version (2021.11.05).\nFor the CG candidates, there are three different kinds of of cases.\nThe above cartoon shows all of the cases:\nGenuine CGs with complete spectroscopic redshifts. Case 1: At least one of the members lacks redshift data but the others have genuine spectroscopic redshifts. Case 2: All the members have genuine spectroscopic redshifts but at least one galaxy without redshift lies in the isolation rings. Case 3: The combination of Cases 1 and 2. Here are the example SDSS images of a genuine CG and each case of CG candidates.\nThe small white circles locate the group members with spectroscopic redshifts, while the small green circles label the galaxies without redshifts. The red circles represent the foreground or background galaxies.\n","date":"2022-11-13T21:40:27+08:00","permalink":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/first/firstpaper/","title":"Compact Groups of Galaxies in SDSS, GAMA, and LAMOST"},{"content":"This website is still under-construction !!\n","date":"2022-11-13T21:40:27+08:00","image":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/about/underconstruction.png","permalink":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/about/about/","title":"This website is still under-construction !"}]
