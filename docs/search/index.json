[{"content":"Since 2024, a large number of images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have continuously revealed a surprising phenomenon: in the first few hundred million years after the birth of the first galaxies, there existed numerous mysterious objects known as \u0026ldquo;Little Red Dots.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom Kokorev et al. (2024)\rFrom the above image, these objects indeed appear as individual “little red dots.” However, it is important to note that the JWST captures images in the infrared band. The “little red dots” we see are mostly “false-color” images created by combining monochromatic images from three bands above 2.5 microns, with blue, green, and red assigned to short, medium, and long wavelengths, respectively, to produce the composite color image.\nHowever, if we use JWST’s short-wavelength infrared bands, such as 1.15 microns (F115W), 1.5 microns (F150W), and 2 microns (F200W), and assign colors from short to long wavelength as blue/green/red, these “little red dots” would actually appear as “little blue dots.”\nIt is important to emphasize, though, that the infrared radiation we see from them actually originates in their ultraviolet and optical emissions. Their high redshifts are what shift this light into the infrared bands for our observation. In fact, the spectra of these little red dots generally exhibit a V-shaped profile, as if two radiation components dominate: one in the ultraviolet, and the other in the infrared.\nWhat is Little Red Dots ?

(2021), which extended the halo-based group finder developed by Yang et al. (2005) and applied it to the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys.\nThis group catalogue has been further updated based on the galaxy catalogue, which has been updated to DR9, containing five-band photometries ($g$, $r$, $z$, W1, W2), with a sky coverage of ∼ 100 million groups with ∼ 120 million galaxy members having ∼ 18200 deg$^2$.\nThe halo mass ($M_h$) of each group has been estimated based on abundance matching between the total group luminosity and ~ 600,000 DESI groups overlaid on eFEDS footprint.\nThese groups span a large redshift range of $0.0 \\le z_g \\le 1.0$ and (group) halo mass of $10^{10.76}h^{-1}M_\\odot \\le M_h \\le 10^{15.0}h^{-1}M_\\odot$.\nThe identification of Blind-detected X-ray Sources Brunner et al. (2021), present catalogs of 27910 (main) and 4774 (supplementary) X-ray sources detected in the 0.2–2.3 keV band. Salvato et al. (2021) presented that ~ 10% blind-detected point sources (Extended Likelihood = 0) are more likely to be galactic sources.\nBefore measuring the count rates for each group, we cross-match the DESI groups with these blind-detected sources. We find 10932 blind-detected sources might emitted from the hot gas or AGN within groups and these sources are regarded as the X-ray center of the matched group.\nThe above figure shows an example eFEDS image (left-hand panel) for a blind-detected source (blue solid circle) overplotted with the probable DESI groups that might host it. The red solid circles show the regions within a distance of $R_{180}$ from the BGG of each candidate group. In this example, we regard the most massive one (group #2906) hosts that X-ray emission. The neighbour X-ray emission (blue-dashed circles) is also considered as part of the extended X-ray emission from the same group, while the others (grey-dashed circles) are regarded as contaminants. The red-dashed circle represents the region within a distance of $R_{180}$ but re-centred on that X-ray emission. The right-hand panel shows the corresponding DESI image. In both panels, the BGG and satellites of group #2906 are marked by magenta filled and green opened circles, respectively.\nMost of the groups donot have blind-detected counterparts, their BGG are thus regarded as the X-ray center. By stacking the X-ray images of the groups that have no resolved X-ray centres, the BGG can well represent the X-ray peak of a group system, and the average surface brightness profiles roughly follow the β-model prediction.\nCalculate the Count Rate for each Group We use two different algorithms to measure the luminosities in soft X-ray (rest-frame 0.1– 2.4 keV) band:\nMean Background Subtraction: Calculating a background level averaged over the annulus of $1.5 - 2.0R_{180}$ of each group. The count rates are computed via subtracting the mean background level directly. Patrol Background Subtraction: Removing all of the regions enclosed by contaminants, masked pixels, and the aperture radius of DESI groups. The background level (patrol level) averaged over the remaining regions might potentially contributed by the instrument background, very distant sources, or small groups below the threshold. The count rates computed via subtracting the patrol level suffer the projection effect. First, we assume a tentative $L_{X} − M_{h}$ relation, then generate the mock image and calculate the fraction contributed by each group. we recompute the tentative $L_{X} − M_{h}$ relation and reproduce the process iteratively.\nAfter deriving the count rates for each DESI group, we convert it into soft X-ray flux by dividing the source count rates to ECF. The details can be found here and the derived catalog can be found here.\nMerchandise related to this paper Images in different wavebands have been created for variuos galaxy groups.

As the name suggests, a compact group of galaxies (CG, hereafter) is a kind of special galaxy system where the galaxy members are separated at distances of the order of galaxy size.\nThe above image shows a very typical CG, Stephan’s Quintet, which is photoed by James Webb Space Telescope. Although we call it a “Quintet\u0026quot;, only four of them on the right side of the image are truly close together. The leftmost one, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four galaxies.\nIn CGs, galaxy members frequently interact each other and are expected to form a single elliptical galaxy within a short period. The high density and low velocity dispersion make CG an ideal laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the merging process.\nThe Catalogs of Compact Groups of Galaxies To study the properties of CGs, we select CGs in the Main Galaxy Sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The SDSS Main Galaxy Sample is taken from NYU-VAGC. The original imaging and spectro files are avaliable here. We select the Main Galaxy Sample that contains $\\sim 700,000$ nearby galaxies with redshift $z \\le 0.2$ and $r$-band magnitude of $14.00 \\le r \\le 17.77$, and update their redshift data to the version of SDSS DR14.\nDue to the Fiber Collision Effect, not all of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshift, especially for the galaxies live in a higher number density region. The search for CGs is severely hindered by such effect.\nTo reduce the incompleteness as much as possible, we take the complementary redshift measurements from GAMA and LAMOST datasets. The incompleteness has been reduced from $\\sim 7$ % to $\\sim 5$ %. And we constructed the largest and most complete CG catalogs to date.\nSee this paper for more details in CG selection. Finally, our samples include 6128 CGs with complete redshifts and 8022 CG candidates which might contain interlopers. The original catalog in contains 6144 CGs. However, we remove 16 CGs after a careful inspection of the spectroscopic data of all group members, where the spectroscopic redshifts of few member galaxies have been incorrectly reused during the CG construction. These catalogs are avaliable here: Old Version (2020.01.02); Latest Version (2021.11.05).\nFor the CG candidates, there are three different kinds of of cases.\nThe above cartoon shows all of the cases:\nGenuine CGs with complete spectroscopic redshifts. Case 1: At least one of the members lacks redshift data but the others have genuine spectroscopic redshifts. Case 2: All the members have genuine spectroscopic redshifts but at least one galaxy without redshift lies in the isolation rings. Case 3: The combination of Cases 1 and 2. Here are the example SDSS images of a genuine CG and each case of CG candidates.\nThe small white circles locate the group members with spectroscopic redshifts, while the small green circles label the galaxies without redshifts. The red circles represent the foreground or background galaxies.\nCompact Group of the Day: 2023 Calendar A DESI image (or SDSS image if no DESI image) for Genuine CG is featured each day. Note that the symbol styles are different from the above example SDSS images.\nWhite solid circles: the galaxy members Red circles: fore/background galaxies Blue circles: outliers with similar redshifts Green circles: very bright galaxies not considered in this work (see paper for details) ","date":"2022-11-13T21:40:27+08:00","image":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/first/ccgs.png","permalink":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/first/firstpaper/","title":"Compact Groups of Galaxies in SDSS, GAMA, and LAMOST"},{"content":"This website is still under-construction !!\n","date":"2022-11-13T21:40:27+08:00","image":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/about/underconstruction.png","permalink":"https://al-yl.github.io/posts/about/about/","title":"This website is still under-construction !"}]
