A galaxy group is a concentration of galaxies assumed to be embedded within an extended dark matter halo, providing cosmological probes of the spatial distribution and growth history of large-scale structure.

We use the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (**eFEDS**) to measure the rest-frame 0.1–2.4 keV band X-ray luminosities of ~ 600,000 DESI groups.

## DESI Group Catalog

The group catalog is taken from [Yang et al. (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abddb2), which extended the halo-based group finder developed by [Yang et al. (2005)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.08560.x) and applied it to the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys.

This group catalogue has been further updated based on the galaxy catalogue, which has been updated to DR9, containing five-band photometries ($g$, $r$, $z$, W1, W2), with a sky coverage of ∼ 100 million groups with ∼ 120 million galaxy members having ∼ 18200 deg$^2$.

The halo mass ($M_h$) of each group has been estimated based on abundance matching between the total group luminosity and ~ 600,000 DESI groups overlaid on eFEDS footprint.

These groups span a large redshift range of $0.0 \le z_g \le 1.0$ and (group) halo mass of $10^{10.76}h^{-1}M_\odot \le M_h \le 10^{15.0}h^{-1}M_\odot$.
